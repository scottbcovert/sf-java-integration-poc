# Salesforce Java Integration PoC

## Getting Started

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` file and set your Salesforce credentials accordingly

Afterward, compiling and executing the Java app should connect to the Salesforce API
and print out a list of records meeting the criteria of a SOQL query.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the default folder to maintain compiled output files (added to .gitignore)
